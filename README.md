## Determining whether an X-ray study of (Musculoskeletal  conditions at humans) is normal or abnormal using Deep  Learning ​— ​Graduation Project (2019):  
### It was research to build a Deep Learning model that helps to determine  whether an X-ray study of (Musculoskeletal conditions at humans) is  normal or abnormal.  We used MURA (musculoskeletal radiographs) dataset provided by  Stanford University, Python as a programming language, Deep Learning  (Convolution Neural Network (CNN)), pre-trained model( DenseNet-161),  and the model was trained using FastAI library that based on top of  PyTorch. 

### The final results were (Final accurecy = 83.4 and kappa score = 66.7).
